### Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you; in this way you will be sons of your Father in heaven.

This command reminds me of the story of a good Samaritan. The Samaritan and Jew don't always like each other but when the Samaritan saw a wounded Jew, his first reaction was he needed my help! Maybe the Jew at first felt reluctant but in his dire condition he had no other choice because he was badly wounded. Their relationship grew from stranger to friendship because of the care the Samaritan had given him. He washed his wounded, patched him up and accompanied him to the inn. He even forked out own money to pay for the shelter because the Jew had no more money. The Samaritan begged the inn owner to help keep an eye for him and promised he would come back for him. 

This is not only a recovery of physical wounds but also spiritual wounds. While the Jew was recovering, the time and efforts that the Samarian put in to help him would change their cold relationship. Before that they might hate each other, but the Samaritan took pity on his enemy and chose to love him by showing him care. His action melted the hatred between them and softened their intense relationship. 

We need this kind of love today, especially in the church. Out of fear we have unintentionally excluded some people when they called us for help. It takes courage to go beyond the current and deny ourselves to love our enemies. There is no denying that we face mild persecution from the authorities during our mission to help others but that shouldn't stop us. God didn't say stop reaching out to those who persecute you but He said love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. We shall pray for those who created troubles for us and love them all. We do the works of compassion and let God rebuild the broken bridges in our community. This is our mission, our call to be the sons of our Father in heaven. 

##### Action:
Pray for those who perecute us, and love the enemies.

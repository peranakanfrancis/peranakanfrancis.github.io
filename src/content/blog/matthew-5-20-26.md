### Go and be reconciled with your brother first, and come back and present the offering.
How is the virtue of the Scribe and Pharisee? They know God’s message very well, they can quote you back with God’s word, they are so devout to perform their priestly duties, they pray everyday and fast but they don’t really do what they preach. Jesus wants us to be as devout as they are but more - to put our faith into action which is to love our neighbor as how we love God so that we may enter into heaven.

When a man is always angry about his brother, the anger will overpower love. Anger if not controlled can spread like a wildfire and turn into malice, defame, abuse, violence and killing. We must control our mouths and be careful of our words. Our word can either help a person and make our heart a better soil for the word of God to sprout or hurt a person and poison our heart and choke the word of God. Jesus humbled himself to become man, walked with the sinners, scorned by the criminals and died on the cross. He showed us the way to love is to first be humble. Opposite of humbleness is pride, and pride kills our nature to love. If we take the word of God seriously, then forgiving is a very important command, we ask God to forgive us everyday when we pray, so in the same way, we must also learn to forgive those who offended us. This way, our love of God will be authentic as we love our neighbor sincerely. Hatred and violence will be fading away when we love one another and peace may be truly attained.

We not only abide by the laws of our country and international laws but all humans are obliged to obey divine commandments and laws. One may escape the law of the earth but no one can ever escape the judgment from God. If we can escape the law and order here on earth and free from punishment but face severe judgment before the throne of God, what good can this temporary freedom bring us? But if we acknowledge our sins and sincerely make up for failure, even our pain and sorrow can be as fragrant as the jasmine flower because like a flower, our pain is only temporary but the pain can heal our troubled conscience and put our heart right in order again. Nothing else is more important than our soul. Be a friend to the word of God so that we will be saved.

Today, here and now, make time to reconcile with our enemies while we still can because one day when we die it will be too late for us to do anything. Now is a time of grace, find Him while we still can.

##### Action:
Reconcile with the people I have offended before.

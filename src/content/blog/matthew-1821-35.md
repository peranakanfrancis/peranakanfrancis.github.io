**The servant’s master felt sorry for him that he let him go and canceled the debt. Were you not bound then, to have pity on your fellow servant just as I had pity on you?**

When I think of God’s debt, many things flashed in my mind. I think of how many people I have hurt since I was small. The human souls that I destroyed and committed sins with especially in my hatred words, stealing, adultery, and destroying my body which is God’s sanctuary. My sins are too big for me to pay back and it is impossible to pay back. God forgave me, let me go, canceled my debt. As I ponder why I am tormented by demons I think this is not punishment that God put on me, but His sanctification grace to pull me out from the darkness. My soul is plunging too deep into the darkness, God is giving me His light but He must put my body to the test so that I may rely on His grace to live and my spirit grow.

I thank God for teaching me to see the problem as why it is happening. I understand the root cause of my own problem is the lack of parent’s love and broken family. I was once angry with my parents, but as soon as I meditated on Jesus’s teaching on forgiveness, I chose to obey and forgive them, even though it was very hard. Soon, God unfolded my parent’s history in front of my eyes, and I understood that they are just like me - the victims of a broken family and they grew up with broken love so what they did to me was not their true intentions. In fact, many people in the world are suffering the same fate as me. The difference is I am redeemed and saved by God, and I am given grace to understand while many don’t. 

The only solution to mend the broken heart is forgiveness because forgiveness leads to reconciliation and reconciliation brings restoration. Forgiveness is a process for our heart to recover from trauma and brokenness but vengeance leads to destruction, it is not the way of God, it brings war and death. The only way is to turn back and always choose to forgive. Turn back to God, turn back to His way. Do not choose our ways or the way the world teaches us because unforgiveness not only brings death to our enemies but also to ourselves. Forgive and love our enemies, pray for those who persecute us, do that we may be sure that God’s love can be perfected in us and our soul will not be ended up in hell fire.

Read and meditate on the bible. God will teach us His truth and His way. 

##### Action:
Forgive your brother from your heart.

### Anyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and anyone who humbles himself will be exalted.

Man has the tendency to show off with his possession, position, and power. But to be a follower of Christ, even though God puts us in a higher position, we mustn’t learn the yeast of the secular world which is proud and strong character but rather we must learn to be meek and humbled from our Lord. For those who think he is intellectual in doing God’s work and defy those God put above him is wrong, he must humble before God humbled him. 

Do not compare, do not judge, no not think I’m the right one but listen to the opinion of others and ask God for discernment. The process is slow and painful but it will humble me down. Humble is a beautiful character and it is very powerful. When God uses me, He will justify me, so I can be a useful instrument for His kingdom. I don’t come to God with my intellect and wisdom because they are useless in front of God, but instead let God mold me and give me His wisdom.

##### Action:
Pray for Humble and want to be humbled.

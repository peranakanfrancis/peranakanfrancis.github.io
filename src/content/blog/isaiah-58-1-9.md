### Fasting like yours today will never make your voice heard on high.

What would you think if your prayers aren't answered no matter how many times you prayed? Why isn’t God answering my prayer? Is He angry? Is there something wrong with my prayers? Or are there some faults in my life that need to be corrected first? I hope you won’t give up so easily and think that God doesn’t exist because that is the biggest lie and you will only fool yourselves. 

In today’s reading, prophet Isaiah, the voice of God, told us why God did not answer the prayers of the people even though they fast and pray, and keep the laws perfectly - it is because of their sins. They thought they were faithful to God by keeping all His observances but what they don’t know is that they have not repented over their sinful ways yet. What are those? They do business on fast-days, they oppress their workers, they quarrel and squabble with people, and they strike the poor with fist. 

Prophet Isaiah reminded us our love of God must not exclude our love for our neighbor because God loves everyone the same. He cares and loves for the poor and oppressed and He wants to set them free, but when we don’t obey His commandment to love one another and only stick to our own sinful ways to oppress others, then our prayers will not be heard on high and our fasting will not be accepted. 

Our almsgiving must be genuine. First we must truly acknowledge our sins and make a commitment to change our behavior to care for the poor and treat them like we would treat ourselves. Almsgiving is not a one time checklist and once we have helped a person then we are done, no! But almsgiving is a way to set ourselves free from our own wicked behavior, it softens our hearts to take pity for the least of the brothers and helps us to listen to the cries of the poor. When our heart is right, we can go on with our Lenten observance to fast and pray with a humble heart and contrite spirit. God who sees our efforts in secret will relent and answer our prayers with grace. 

Prayer is not about talking much, but to loving much - to love God with all our heart, mind, strength and soul and our neighbor too. How to love our neighbor? Stop the oppression and give a fair pay for your workers, share our food with the hungry, clothe the naked, give shelter to the homeless poor and treat our own kin with kindness. When we do this, the truth will set us free and our wounds will be healed over quickly. This is a promise from God for all who love Him that His people will be clothed with integrity and justice and sharing His Glory. Fast, pray and almsgiving are the tools to help us repent.

##### Action
Prayer and my action goes hand in hand. Pray what I do and do what I pray.

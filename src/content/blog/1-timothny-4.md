**Be an example among the faithful in word, in behavior, in charity, in faith, in chastity. Attend to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine. Meditate on these things, so that your progress may be manifest to all. Pay attention to yourself and to doctrine. Pursue these things. For in doing so, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.**

There will always be people criticizing the teaching of the catholic church but I am told to hold firm to our faith and stand firm with the teaching. Be humble to the holy people chosen by God to shepherd his Church and listen to the Church’s teaching. Before I criticize, look at my own life first, am I praying enough, am I having a good relationship with Jesus before voice up against the Church? The Holy Spirit is guiding the Church and every faithful one. So if I confront the Church with my own ideology I might be as well confronting God unintentionally. 

For me, be an example to the faithful in my all in all daily life, in word, behavior, charity, faith and chastity and invest my time in scripture, pope’s exhortation and the doctrine of the catholic church. I might get maligned by people but endure it, stand firm, and give it some time, the fruits will show because the truth and wisdom will vindicate by itself. This is how I can help myself and also help others.

##### Action:
Attend to reading scripture, writing of the saints, exhortation, encyclical, and the doctrine of the church.

**Among the pagans the rules lord it over them. This is not to happen among you. No, anyone who wants to be great among you must be your servant, and anyone who wants to be first among you must be your slave, just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.**

The way of the master is to serve. He gave up the throne in heaven, there He was served by multitude of angels but He humbled himself and came to live on earth in hardcore poverty. His life was a living gospel and His teaching is life. God knows we need Him and He loves us so much that He is willing to sacrifice Himself to save us. 

For His teaching, many of them contradict with human traditions and cultures, if we were to listen to Him, I think we must first have to know Him first and slowly build a better relationship with Him. Otherwise, it would be quite difficult for us to understand the meaning of His divine teachings. But if we fully understand what it means, then we know it is the truth that comes from heaven to teach humans the heavenly values. 

As Christians, the higher our position is, the more we must imitate our Lord to serve. Our life is called to serve - to serve God through prayer and our neighbor through good deeds, so that our love may be perfected and others may witness God through our lives. Poverty of love is a fact, it is a current issue in the world ever since the fallen of Adam and Eve and it is also the reason to blame for many sufferings and pain in the society. The only remedy for this hurting world is love, and to love we must repent and listen to Jesus, so that He may lead us back to God our Father. Serving others is an act of love, it is self denial but conforms to Godâ€™s will, it is the fruit of repentance. For we did not seek to serve but always had others to serve our needs, this is why we become selfish and selfishness creates poverty, injustices and suffering. Selfishness damages our soul because it is a sin. God calls us to love and through serving others, our love may grow, and our wounds may be quickly healed over. This is the way of life.

##### Action:
Serving out of love.
